**Records Fetching Table**

I have created a record-fetching table using a relational database (MySQL) with a unique record set. Once a record is saved to the database, I created REST APIs using Spring Boot to retrieve the data. These APIs allow me to fetch and display the stored SQL data in a structured table format on the frontend. I am using React for the frontend, which communicates with the Spring Boot backend to consume the APIs and display the data on the UI in a tabular format.
